## Title: Uncertainty estimation in time series forecasting with machine learning
Machine learning regression models are optimized to get point estimates as accurately as possible, and often the quantification of error is summarized in a single metric. However, in many circumstances, it is indispensable to have reliable uncertainty estimations for individual predictions. This is the case for scientific results and for applications that are critical to safety or health. In this project, a baseline deep learning forecasting model will be trained on a public time series dataset, as well as in synthetic data. Among the following approaches for uncertainty estimation, some will be implemented and compared, depending on the interest of the students and the rate of progress of the work: deep ensemble, Monte Carlo dropout, bayesian neural network and conformal prediction.
